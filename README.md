# Achiiive Icons

'Achiiive-Icons' is a asset-pipeline version of [achiiive-fonts](https://github.com/achiiive/achiiive-fonts). This is very experimental and its only purpose is to make it easier to maintain or add our official icons used in our service. We make this repo public for now, but this won't be helpful for any other projects.

```ruby
gem 'achiiive_icons', git: 'git@github.com:achiiive/achiiive_icons.git'
```
and in css manifesto

```css
/*
 *= require achiiive_fonts
 */
```

or if you use scss(sass)
```scss
@import 'achiiive_fonts';
// or
@import 'achiiive_fonts/icons'
```

and then...
